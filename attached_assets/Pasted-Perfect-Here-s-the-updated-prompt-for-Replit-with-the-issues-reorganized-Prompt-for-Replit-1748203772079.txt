Perfect! Here's the updated prompt for Replit with the issues reorganized:

**Prompt for Replit:**

I need you to analyze the current FM Player Tracker codebase and create a sequential implementation plan to address the following UI/UX feedback for the squad overview screen. Please:

1. **Understand each change** listed below
2. **Identify the specific fix** needed for each issue
3. **Create a logical sequence** for implementing these fixes (considering dependencies - if fix A solves issue B, do A first; if fix D would break something needed for fix C, do D before C)
4. **Guide me through each fix step-by-step** (explain the fix, ask me to proceed, have me test, then move to next)

**Feedback to Address:**

**Issue 1 - High Potential Tile:** Remove the "High Potential" tile from the top section (currently showing 0 players). This metric is problematic as "high potential" varies significantly across football levels and creates a moving target.

**Issue 2 - Position Filter Broken:** The position dropdown filter doesn't work - selecting a position doesn't filter the player list below.

**Issue 3 - Spacing/Alignment Issues:** The "position analysis" label has inconsistent spacing - it's positioned ~1px after the age filter dropdown with too much space before its own dropdown. Make the padding consistent: same spacing between age filter dropdown and "position analysis" label as between position filter dropdown and age filter dropdown, and reduce spacing between "position analysis" label and its dropdown.

**Issue 4 - Convert to Table View:** Replace the current player tile layout with a table format where each row is a player showing: name, age, position, CA, PA (displayed as circles that are full when value is 200 and empty when value is 1), and all attributes grouped by Technical, Goalkeeper, Mental, Physical categories. Implement color-coding for attribute values based on ranges.

**Issue 5 - Position Mapping:** The position field in the table needs to list positions as they are defined in the tool, requiring interpretation of HTML import data into discrete positions. For example, "D (LC)" from the HTML file should be interpreted and displayed as "DL, DC" in the tool.

**Issue 6 - Remove Non-functional Button:** Remove the "load more players" button at the bottom since all players are already displayed.

Please analyze the current code, determine the implementation order for these fixes, and then walk me through them one by one, starting with your recommended sequence and asking for my approval before proceeding with each fix.
