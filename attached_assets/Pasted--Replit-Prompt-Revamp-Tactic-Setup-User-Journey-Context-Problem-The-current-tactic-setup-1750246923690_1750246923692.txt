# Replit Prompt: Revamp Tactic Setup User Journey

## **Context & Problem**
The current tactic setup process requires users to navigate through multiple screens with numerous dropdowns. When a position+role+duty combination is created for the first time, it triggers additional screens for attribute assignment. This creates too many steps and friction.

## **Solution: Single-Screen Grid Interface**

Create a revamped tactic setup that consolidates everything into one screen using a table/spreadsheet-like interface.

### **Grid Structure**
- **Columns**: Positions must match the formation selected in the previous screen (e.g., if 4-3-3 selected, show GK, RB, CB, CB, LB, CM, CM, CM, RW, ST, LW)
- **Rows**: 
  - Position dropdown (top)
  - Role dropdown 
  - Duty dropdown
  - Separator
  - Technical attributes section
  - Mental attributes section  
  - Physical attributes section
  - Goalkeeping attributes section (when applicable)

### **Key Features to Implement**

1. **Formation Integration**
   - Read the formation selected from the previous screen
   - Generate columns that exactly match the positions in that formation
   - Position dropdowns should be pre-populated or constrained based on formation

2. **Smart Pre-selection**
   - If a position+role+duty combination has been created previously, automatically pre-select the key and preferred attributes when user selects those dropdowns
   - Load existing attribute configurations from previous setups

3. **Dynamic Attribute Categories**
   - When GK is selected: Technical section shows goalkeeping attributes (Aerial Reach, Command of Area, Communication, etc.)
   - When outfield position selected: Technical section shows outfield attributes (Corners, Crossing, Dribbling, etc.)
   - Mental and Physical attributes remain the same for all positions

4. **Attribute Selection**
   - Each attribute row has toggle buttons for Key/Preferred selection
   - Visual indicators: different colors/styles for Key vs Preferred vs unselected
   - Use the Football Manager attribute definitions from the uploaded guide

5. **Visual Enhancement**
   - Progress indicator showing "X/11 positions configured"
   - Column headers highlight when position is fully configured
   - Clear visual distinction between configured and empty positions
   - Smart defaults for common role/duty combinations

6. **User Flow**
   - User configures Position/Role/Duty dropdowns across the top
   - Attributes auto-populate based on position type
   - Previously used combinations auto-select their key/preferred attributes
   - Click to toggle Key/Preferred attributes for each position
   - Auto-save functionality
   - "Generate Tactic" or equivalent action appears when all positions complete

### **Requirements**
- **IMPORTANT**: Please read the project_status.md file first to understand the current project structure and maintain consistency
- Desktop-only interface (no mobile responsive needed)
- Users must configure all positions to proceed (number depends on formation)
- Maintain consistency with existing project architecture and patterns
- Avoid creating technical debt - follow established conventions
- Integrate seamlessly with current player analysis and recommendation features

### **Data Structure Considerations**
- Store position, role, duty, and selected key/preferred attributes for each position in the formation
- Reference the Football Manager attributes guide for accurate attribute names and categories
- Ensure data structure supports the existing analysis features
- Maintain historical data of position+role+duty combinations for smart pre-selection

## **Instructions for Implementation**

Please:
1. **First, recap what you understood** from this prompt and the current project state
2. **Provide a detailed step-by-step implementation plan** with clear milestones
3. **Start with step 1 only** when I give you the green light
4. **After completing each step**: Write and run unit tests, provide evidence they passed
5. **Wait for my approval** before proceeding to the next step

**Do not proceed to implement anything until I explicitly ask you to start with step 1.**
